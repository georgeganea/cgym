= Syntax =

`cgym list [DIRECTORY] server1`

`     get [-n N] file server1 server2 ... serverN`

= List mode =

When started with list as the second argument, the cgym client will connect to *server1* and request information about the contents of *DIRECTORY*. If *DIRECTORY* is omitted, it will request information about the root directory (*/*).

= Get mode =

When started using the get argument, the cgym client will try to download the contents of *file* from the specified servers (*server1*, *server2* ... *serverN*). It will split the transfer in *N* segments, or, if the *-n* option is omitted, will split the transfer by the number of servers given.

= Return codes =

The program returns zero on success, and non-zero on error.
